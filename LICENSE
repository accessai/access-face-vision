Capitalized terms that are not contained herein have the same meaning as in the License Agreement.
1. DEFINITIONS
1.1.  “Bug” means a technical aspect or functionality of the Software that does not execute as outlined in the Documentation. Unexpected behavior isolated to Customer’s specific configuration or environment does not constitute a Bug. Support Incident is recognized as a Bug only after it has been reproduced in steps provided by Customer and has been confirmed by a ConvexHull Support Engineer.

1.3.  “Designated Support Contact” means Customer’s employee who is authorized to contact ConvexHull’s support center.
1.4.  “Error” means a defect that causes the Software not to perform substantially in accordance with the specifications set forth in ConvexHull’s Documentation.
1.5.  “Installation” means the process in which the Software installation program is extracted from a CD, diskette, downloaded executable, or network drive onto a single computer’s hard drive, and the setup program is run to completion in accordance with the authorized installation instructions. A completed installation is determined by the successful first run of the Software. This does not include configuration of other applications required by the Software, including, but not limited to Microsoft Windows, Microsoft IIS, SMTP, Microsoft SQL Server, firewalls, or networking components.

A single Support Incident may involve multiple phone calls, emails and off-line research.
